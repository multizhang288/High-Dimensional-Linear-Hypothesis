Folder NPE_FULL

 -Functions.R This file contains all the necessary self-defined functions.
 
 -NPE_1.R The R script of the proposed method without power enhancement term JPE. The paper discusses numerous parameter settings; for simplicity in demonstration, we have set the parameters to fixed values.
 
 -PPE_1.R The R script of the partial penalized method in Shi et.al, (2019).
 
 -SIHR.R The R script of the SIHR package.

Due to the computational cost, we are providing all the outputs from the paper directly.

 NPE_Results: all the outputs of NPE.
 
 SIHR_Results: all the outputs of SIHR.
 
 PPE_Results: all the outputs of PPE

Sub-folder Summary: We use Data_Analysis.R to compile all the outputs into more easily readable Big Tables.

  -NPE_model_1_covmatrix_AR.csv: Model N1, covariance matrix Sigma is AR(1), the proposed method.
  
   delta: corresponding to different alternative hypothesis.
   
   Size1: empirical rejection rate of single sample splitting.
   
   Size2: empirical rejection rate of double sample splitting.
   
   Size3: empirical rejection rate of full sample.
   
   Time1, Time2, and Time3: the average computation time of single, double, and full sample method.

  -PPE_model_5_combine_False.csv: Model N5, single sample splitting, the partial penalized method.
  
   Size_PPE: empirical rejection rate of the PPE method.
   
   In single sample splitting, Size2 and Size3 are 0.
   
   In the double sample splitting "True", Size1 is 0.
   
  -SIHR_model_1_M_I.csv: The results of the SIHR method for model n1, using the SIHR-specified matrix

Folder PE_FULL

 -Functions.R This file contains all the necessary self-defined functions.
 
 -PE_1.R The R script of the proposed method with power enhancement term JPE. The paper discusses numerous parameter settings; for simplicity in demonstration, we have set the parameters to fixed values.
 
 Sub-folder Summary: We use Data_Analysis.R to compile all the outputs into more easily readable Big Tables.
 
  -ERR_model_1_combine_False.csv: The results of model 1 by using single sample splitting strategy.
  
   T_PE1: empirical rejection rate of single sample splitting strategy.
   
  -ERR_model_1_combine_True.csv: The results of model 1 by using double sample splitting strategy.
  
   T_PE2: empirical rejection rate of double sample splitting.
   
   T_PE3: empirical rejection rate of full sample.
   
   MCL: the empirical rejection rate of the MCL method. 
   
   Note for MCL method: Only in Models 1 and 2 under Method 1, there is a theoretical guarantee of the asymptotic property of the MCL method (Ma et al., 2021). Therefore, values from other models are excluded.
